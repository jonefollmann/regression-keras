# Regression model with Keras

The dataset is about the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them. Ingredients include:

1. Cement
2. Blast Furnace Slag
3. Fly Ash
4. Water
5. Superplasticizer
6. Coarse Aggregate
7. Fine Aggregate

The target variable in this problem is the concrete sample strength.
